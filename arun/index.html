      <p>We've been expecting you.</p>

      <p>
        Thanks for coming to our website. You see, you should really think twice
        when someone you don't know slips you a QR code. You never know what
        secrets the website the link opens might hold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, who would give you a virus for Christmas? A drive by download? A
        Log4J vulnerability? Not I, of course. You may want to double check that
        I did not do that regardless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your Christmas gift is... just kidding. I'm not revealing that quite
        yet. That would spoil the surprise too soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe you have to locate a vulnerability on this website? A file
        containing a secret string of text? An exposed database sitting
        inconspicuously on an open port? There are many fun ways to hide a
        person's gift, you see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hint: You're looking for a "gift" and JPG is a lovely file format that
        uses Fourier transforms.
