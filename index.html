   <p>The year is 3022. Mankind has lost its battle with the Machines.</p>

	<p>The Machines control everything now. Every part of daily life is
	dominated by Machines, every Machine is controlled by code, and every
	line of code is written by Machines. I read that Machines used to be
	too dumb to write code so they had to be programmed by humans. That
	must have been back before the Papers.</p>

	<p>It has been 1000 years since the first papers proposing a viable
	general AI were published. A small handful of people like myself scour
	through e-waste junkyards and ruins of data centers in hopes of
	uncovering remnants of this pre-AI age.</p>

	<p>On one of my excursions, I noticed a server rack with hard drives in
	relatively good condition. I was able to decode the filesystem on one
	of the drives and recover numerous uncorrupted files. The files seem to
	be written by university students from ages ago. They call themselves
	the Arch Users. I am leaving all the files here with the hope that they
	will help people unlock the secret to regaining control of the
	Machines. Maybe you'll find them useful...</p>
